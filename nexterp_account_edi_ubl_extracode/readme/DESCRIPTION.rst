This module extends the UBl format (e-factura) functionality by adding additional codes to enhance the information provided in the invoices.
The added codes include:

- **BT-16 - Delivery Slip Number**: The number associated with the delivery slip for the items being invoiced.
- **BT-71 - Delivery Location Identifier**: A unique code assigned to each item in the invoice, - gln code from partner.
- **BT-156 - Buyer Item Code**: A unique code assigned by the buyer for each item.
- **BT-157- StandardItemIdentificati**: The European Article Number (EAN) code for each item, which is a standard for identifying products - barcode from product.



These enhancements are particularly useful for businesses that require detailed tracking and identification of items in their electronic invoices.
