# Changelog

## 19.0.1.2.0 (2026-09-15)

- Drop the base `Warehouse of ... should be in Romania` error on the
  counterparty side of intra-EU / import / export operations, which
  `l10n_ro_edi_stock` started raising unconditionally and which made those
  notifications impossible to send.
- Fix `AttributeError` when the ANAF response has an unexpected shape:
  `ETransportAPI` is a plain class, so the module-level `_` has to be used
  instead of `self.env._`.
- `_compute_l10n_ro_edi_stock_enable_send` now only widens the states the base
  does not already cover ('assigned' has been allowed upstream since 19.0).

## 19.0.1.0.0 (2026-06-23)

- _Changelog tracking starts at this release._
